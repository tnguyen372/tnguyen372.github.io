### Thomas Nguyen's Portfolio Website.

# Current Projects in Development
_________________________________
### Portfolio Website
- Working on hosting my portfolio on a service like Digital Ocean droplets or AWS 

### Hotel Redeemable Offers
- Checks a hotel finder website like Hyatt.com for hotel room offers that can be redeemed with a point amount specified by the user
- Requirements: Takes in user input such as a specific hotel, checkin/out dates, and point amount then displays a list of hotel room offers that can be redeemed 
- Scalability issues to consider: Current requirements are for only for 1 website. What if the user wants to use this service to check other websites like Marriott or Hilton at the same time? How about 10 websites?
- Tech used: Most likely MERN stack to improve my skills
